# EDU Snake Game

An interactive web-based learning tool that combines the classic Snake gameplay with language education features.

Created for my nieces: Zosia and Gabrysia.

### Game Concept

Players navigate a snake to collect the correct letters that complete words displayed on screen. For example, in Polish language learning, players might need to choose between "ó" or "u" in words like "królik". The game uses multiple word lists focused on commonly confused letter patterns across different languages.

### Tools

Vanilla JavaScript and Canvas API.
